# Whack-A-Skeletor

I created a Whack-A-Mole game using Skeletor as the object to hit. User gets 60 seconds to get as many points as possible. Skeletor gives an evil laugh at the
end of the game.

I am still trying to add background music to add a little flavor to the game. In the sounds folder, I have uploaded the peppy theme to the Price is Right 
to contrast the dark tone of the graphics.
