# Whack-A-Skeletor

I created a Whack-A-Mole game using Skeletor as the object to hit. User gets 60 seconds to get as many points as possible. Skeletor gives an evil laugh at the
end of the game.
Background music problem has been resolved!!! I have uploaded the theme to the Price is Right to contrast the dark tone of the graphics. It's not perfect, but it's progress nevertheless!
